}  Goal: “expose” datasets on the Web
§  remember the importance of data!
}  Set links among the data items from different
datasets
§ we want to avoid the silo effects
5.11
(172) 172
Available on the web (whatever format), but with an
open license
Available as machine-readable structured data (e.g.,
excel instead of an image scan)
As before, but using a non-proprietary format (e.g.,
CSV instead of excel)
All the above, plus use open standards (RDF & Co.) to
identify things, so that people could point at your stuff
All the above, plus link your data to other people’s data
to provide context
5.12

}  DBpedia is a community effort to
§  extract structured (“infobox”) information from Wikipedia
§  provide a query endpoint to the dataset
§  interlink the DBpedia dataset with other datasets on the Web

Linked Data: Design Issues
Origin
First proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006
https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html
What’s a “link”?
Technically, a link is a triple where
• the subject IRI is in one graph (namespace) and
• the predicate and/or object are in a different graph (namespace)
Types of Links
Identity Link: points to the same object or concept in another knowledge graph
(e.g., Canada in DBpedia and Wikidata)
Relationship Link: points to other objects related to a given one (e.g., from a person
to the city they live in)
Vocabulary Link: between data and their vocabulary term
(e.g., IRI is a foaf:Person) or between vocabulary terms
(e.g., ex:Student rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person)
5.24
Creating Links
Instance Level
Creating links on the instance level (IRIs):
owl:sameAs Most widely used, but makes strong assumptions about both IRIs
being identical (it is symmetric and transitive)
rdfs:seeAlso Just a reference, makes no claim about the IRIs being identical
(no specific semantics)
using vocabularies e.g., skos:exactMatch, foaf:knows
Schema Level
Two graphs can also be linked on the schema level:
• Using owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty
• Using rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf
• Using vocabularies, e.g., skos:broadMatch or skos:narrowMatch
5.25
Linked Data: Design Issues II
The “four rules”
1 Use URIs as names for things.
2 Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
3 When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards
(RDF, SPARQL).
4 Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things.
5.26
How to create your own URIs
Copyright 2014 by Manning Publications Co., [WZRH14]
5.27
Major Points
To create a knowledge base in
LOD-compliant format:
1 Make your data “5-star”
2 Create URIs following the
guidelines
3 Select appropriate
vocabularies
4 Extend existing vocabularies
if necessary
5 Link your data to other
knowledge graphs
6 Publish your knowledge
graph on the web

Knowledge Base Design
Unlike (relational) databases, knowledge bases do not have a rigid, pre-defined
design for a specific application
• Encourage inter-connection of knowledge
• Still helpful to have an idea of possible use cases
Design Method
• Start with a set of questions to guide the design of the vocabulary and data
triples
• It must be possible to answer the questions when the knowledge base has
been constructed
• These competency questions can be seen as a requirements specification for a
vocabulary or knowledge base
5.53
Competency Questions: Examples
Examples
Some possible competency questions for a university knowledge graph:
Q1: Which courses are offered at University X?
Q2: Which topics are covered by a course C?
Q3: Which professors teach at university X?
Q4: What are the prerequisites for a given course C?
Q5: Which universities offer courses that cover topic T ?
Note
These mostly follow a single pattern
Which [CE1] [OPE] [CE2]?
5.54
Competency Question: Patterns
Towards Competency Question-Driven Ontology Authoring, https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978- 3- 319- 07443- 6_50
CQ Archetypes (PA = Predicate Arity, RT = Relation Type, M = Modifier, DE = Domain-independent Element; obj. =
object property relation, data. = datatype property relation, num. = numeric modifier, quan. = quantitative modifier, tem.
= temporal element, spa. = spatial element; CE = class expression, OPE = object property expression, DP = datatype
property, I = individual, NM = numeric modifier, PE = property expression, QM = quantity modifier)
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-07443-6_50
5.55
Testing Competency Questions
Example: African Wildlife Ontology (AWO)
Competency question awo_6 “Which plants eat animals?”
Verify using a SPARQL query:
SELECT DISTINCT ?eats
WHERE {
?eats rdfs:subClassOf awo:plant, [
a owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty awo:eats;
owl:someValuesFrom awo:animal
] .
FILTER(?eats != owl:Nothing)
}
See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338424817_Dataset_of_ontology_
competency_questions_to_SPARQL-OWL_queries_translations
Another approach: SHACL
There is also a separate standard, the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)
(https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/), see [HHDF20] for an example.

DBpedia Spotlight

5.63
DBpedia Spotlight: Disambiguation
→ Worksheet #4: Task 7
5.64
Approach
Spotlight uses a statistical model for disambiguation
• Using the context of a word/phrase
• Learned from the Wikipedia pages including the links (for multiple languages)
A 2012 paper reports a 85.1% accuracy for English (with 7.4% missing links)
Discussion
• Modern approaches for disambiguation use word embeddings (discussed later
in the course), with better performance
• However, Spotlight is a stable, easy-to-install tool and useful for first
experiments

Extracting Structured Data
→ Worksheet #4: Task 8
5.75
5.76
Idea
• Turn web page into graph object
• Provide rich information when pages are “shared”
• Similar idea to schema.org, except now
Facebook is the consumer (instead of search
engines)
• Vocabulary at http://ogp.me/ns#
Used together with the “Like” button
• When clicked, Facebook creates a connection in its graph between the page
and the user
• If the user was logged in, add information to user’s profile
Facebook Graph Search
• Facebook provided public graph search functionality from 2013–2019
• These have been largely removed, most likely due to privacy concerns
http://ogp.me/ns#
5.77
Example
Page with OGP annotations
• Simple vocabulary for title,
description, images, videos, music,
etc.
• Added to meta-tags in HTML page
• Not using full RDF
<meta property="og:url" content="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/arts/
international/when-great-minds-dont-think-alike.html" />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
<meta property="og:title" content="When Great Minds Don’t Think Alike" />
<meta property="og:description" content="How much does culture influence creative thinking?" />
<meta property="og:image" content="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/19/arts/
