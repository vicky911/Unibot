Components of your ePortfolio will be due incrementally so that, by the end of course, you will have a version of an ePortfolio that you can share with potential collaborators and/or employers. No previous Wordpress knowledge is required. 

Your ePortfolio is a personal website that encapsulates your work as a graduate student and early career professional. Think of it as an expanded CV. Whereas a CV ?tells? the reader of your achievements, the ePortfolio ?shows? the reader what you?ve done in detail. ePortfolio?s are increasingly requested in job applications since they summarize your skills and accomplishments in a way that is aesthetically pleasing. It is an opportunity to show your professional identity and maybe even be discovered! 

The ePortfolio for this course will contain the following pages: 
1.	About: a brief biographical statement
2.	Contact: a way to encourage correspondence 
3.	Projects: publications, multimedia/audiovisual works, media appearances, etc. 
4.	Optional pages for your education, research interests, extracurricular activities, etc.

This hybrid course spans 4 weeks with four 1-hour synchronous lectures over Zoom on Friday mornings. Between the weekly lectures, participants MUST consult recommended videos available through the Udemy workshop, ?Wordpress for Beginners - Master Wordpress Quickly? taught by Andrew Williams. These videos will cover essential information that will not be covered in the lectures but is key to building your ePortfolio. A Moodle site will also exist.

Conflict occurs every day in the workplace. Amidst this conflict, real (sometimes deep!) improvement can be made to the work performed by a team.  Sometimes, conflict will appear to be resolved but will resurface every now and then, a little bit like recurring back pain. Other conflict unfortunately escalates to the point where usual tasks cannot be performed efficiently. Everybody reacts differently towards conflict. Knowing one self and managing relationships are at the very core of our ability to manage conflict.

Although there is no single methodology to resolve conflict, this online training will allow you to better understand how to act when conflict is detected. You can also count on Benoit Lamontagne?s expertise to provide you with the best possible tools to implement long-lasting, efficient and effective processes.

It is the general legal regime which governs the creation and use of most cultural, scientific or knowledge works. As authors of theses and other documents, graduate students are key stakeholders in copyright. This workshop aims to raise awairness of copyright issues in writing a thesis. 
  
After presenting general information about copyright, we will discuss how it applies to you as the author of a thesis. First and foremost, we will cover copyright ownership and licensing of your thesis. For example, all thesis written at Concordia University, since 2008, are available via an open archive called Spectrum on the internet site of the Libraries. Following this, we will discuss the use of copyrighted content within your thesis, such as images, tables, etc. The two main points to consider are exceptions to copyright as well as the process to seek permission. 
~~~

In this workshop, participants will:
1- Understand the basic functioning of copyright. 
2- Identify copyright issues related to your thesis. 
3- Determine the proper course of action to address copyright issues.

This workshop is led by Olivier Charbonneau. 

Olivier is a Senior Librarian at Concordia University. He holds a doctoral degree from the FacultÃ© de droit, UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, where he studied the interaction of copyright exceptions and licensing.

49812,CEPS,1124EO,Exploring Legal and Ethical Aspects of AI (Online),3,"*VID*
*KEYB*

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives. 
*CNT*
This training will enable you to:
?	Analyze international data protection laws in the US, Canada, Europe and China;
?	Evaluate and analyze the role of ethical and legal implications associated with the boom of international AI initiatives and the development of ethical principles in AI;

49902,GPLL,440,Developing a competitive scholarship application: Strategies and tips for all disciplines,2,"***This workshop is intended for current or future students in research-based graduate programs, who are preparing a Fall scholarship application to a federal or provincial government research agency.***

Writing strategies and tips can often be applied globally, so this workshop aims to offer ways that graduate students can develop and improve their scholarship applications. For example, this workshop will offer writing tips to aid in the development of many standard and essential sections of the application (e.g. outline of proposed research, and other applicant statements). Funding agencies typically expect students to be the author of their own applications, but this does not mean writing in isolation ? and does not exclude the important contributions and feedback of peers, research supervisors and other mentors.  

Note: Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out on by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they select.
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
?	Identify peers to provide essential feedback on sections of the application, as well as the application as a whole.
?	Consider ways to benchmark against materials from previous scholarship winners.
?	Adapt their writing and presentation styles to present achievements in succinct and effective ways.

*KEYB*

At first, online meetings were an alternative to the sometimes-chaotic conference call with its infamous ?mute? button. Nowadays, online meetings are more common within organizations and most of us must either prepare, animate or attend online meetings several times a week. It?s actually a reality many people experienced in Spring 2020?

The technology has greatly evolved which allows shorter setup time, fewer interruptions and better visual and sound quality. However, some meetings are still ending with an unsatisfactory feeling of not being as efficient as a ?regular meeting?.  Can we overcome this feeling? What are the best practices for online meetings?  What can we do to improve? Feeling like those questions are eating you alive? Don?t panic. Register now!
*CNT*
This training will enable you to:
?	Learn about the main differences between the various types of meetings (face-to-face, over the phone, online, etc.);
?	Develop strategies to optimize communications while conducting an online meeting;
?	Find out how to properly prepare for an online meeting;
?	Recognize the key roles for an efficient online meeting;
?	Understand the key success factors for an efficient online meeting.
*APP*
This online workshop is based on co-active learning, theoretical information, real-world examples and case studies. In short, you?ll grow professionally by mastering your ability to learn, work and be productive remotely.

49776,CEPS,1111EO,Exploring Data Integration and ETL (Online),3,"*VID*
*KEYB*

Today, data is a powerful asset for any organization. Data is literally everywhere and it is growing exponentially: 500 million tweets or 294 billion emails per day, 65 billion messages on WhatsApp, etc. This high volume, combined with the variety of sources (i.e., structured, unstructured, etc.) and the velocity or pace of the data generation brings multiple opportunities for value creation. You won?t be surprised to learn it also brings about some challenges such as data collection, storage, analysis and most importantly, integration.

A properly designed data integration process is THE key step to combine different data sources by adapting their format, fields and the way they are consumed. For this to happen, ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tools are a simple and scalable solution. During this workshop, expert Adrian Gonzalez-Sanchez will provide you with a proper understanding of the data-driven value creation process, the main data integration techniques and tools, and how to design a solid and scalable ETL workflow. Intrigued? We?d be surprised if you weren?t.
*CNT*
This training will enable you to:
?	Understand the different types of data and their potential value;
?	Explore data integration techniques and choose those that are the best fit for your data sources;
?	Explain traditional issues and challenges of data exploration, and the role of the ETL tools to solve them;
?	Present the most important ETL tools, their subscription models and advantages.

49462,GPLL,12,From Scholarly Research to Crafting an Op-Ed,2,"Although academic journals and other scholarly outlets are valuable, their impact outside of academia is questionable as scholarly publications often sit in digital repositories where they are rarely read by non-academics.

Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. 

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.

In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed. During the second half of the session, participants will practice writing a news ?lede? and ?hook? (e.g., the key introductory components of an op-ed) that is relevant to their research field. 
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to:

1.	Understand the importance of writing op-eds as a grad student;
2.	Identify when and how to join a news conversation;
3.	Identify the key components of an op-ed and understand their functions;
4.	Understand and evaluate journalistic writing styles;
5.	Write an impactful news ?lede? and ?hook?;
6.	Apply appropriate strategies to effectively pitch an editor.

48521,FFAR,257,History and Visual Culture of Gaming,3,"This lecture course introduces students to digital games, their history and their relationship to contemporary art practices. Digital games are considered as a medium of play, social interaction and artistic expression. The course situates digital games in an (art) historical context in order to better understand concepts of play in a digital age and the relevance of games to current art practices, beginning with examples of earlier games and their role as material culture. Students then reconsider the roles played by the art, the artist and the player/gamer as they are situated at the intersection between art, play and technology. Class discussions address life in virtual spaces and the relationships of power, capital, gender, ethnicity and other identities to both games and contemporary digital media.

8852,ENGL,340,Modernism,6,"""The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the """"Jazz Age,"""" the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).""

*KEYB*
Let's face it, some people are intimidated by museums and galleries. They don't know how to approach a work of art, how to interpret it. They might even be afraid to say something that sounds silly, or worse, stupid. Thankfully, there are people in the museum to help them develop their ability to better understand and appreciate art. And you might be one of them. But first, you'll need to complete this course. All of the guides at the MMFA have and we're confident you will, too. This course will challenge your vision of the traditional role of a guide in an art museum and give you the tools to offer visitors meaningful learning experiences. If you want to help bring art to life, this course is a masterpiece.
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
?	Understand the contexts in which the work of an MMFA guide occurs;
?	Reflect critically on the role and practice of a guide;
?	Identify multiple ways for interpreting works of art;
?	Research artists and objects in the MMFA collection using in-house and online resources;
?	Create a scenario as the basis for encounters with groups of visitors;
?	Facilitate group art interpretation that encourages observation, reflection, meaning-making, and dialogue; 
?	Contribute to ongoing collective learning amongst fellow guide recruits through mutual support, shared responsibility and active participation.
*APP*
This is a blend of theory and active learning through  demonstrations, ongoing feedback, workshops, guest speakers, both in the classroom and in the galleries. Active, enthusiastic participation is one of the keys to success in this course.
*WHO*
?	Anyone who wants to help bring art to life in the MMFA.
?	Anyone who wants to become a volunteer guide at the MMFA.

37304,GPTK,701,Peer Instruction: Engaging Students in Small and Large Classrooms,2,"Peer instruction is a research-based pedagogy that actively engages students in the classroom and has been shown to dramatically improve conceptual understanding, even in large classes. The basic goals of peer instruction are to encourage and make use of student interaction during lectures, while focusing students' attention on underlying concepts and techniques. The method has been assessed in many studies using standardized, diagnostic tests and shown to be considerably more effective than the conventional lecture approach to teaching. Peer instruction is now used in a wide range of courses. In this workshop, participants will learn about peer instruction, serve as the &quot;class&quot; in which peer instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources. While successfully implementing peer instruction doesn't require any technology, using the right technology can improve student engagement, increase learning, and make it easier to implement peer instruction in your classroom.
~~~
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to 
1. Articulate challenges in engaging students in lecture-based classes
2. Explain how Peer Instruction can be used to address identified challenges with student engagement 
3. Reflect on the relationship between technology and pedagogy in the service of student learning 
4. Think differently and holistically about what makes good teaching and learning

Adopting the strategies for creating cohesive ideas, impactful statements, and a logical flow is crucial to any academic writing career. 

Applicable to graduate-level writers of all backgrounds, the Perfecting the Paragraph workshop aims to provide participants with an understanding of the most common mistakes that lead to unconvincing, unclear writing. Taking the paragraph as an ?idea? unit, the workshop looks at the formulation and purpose of the topic sentence. It then focuses on paragraph structure, development of the main  idea, transition to the next paragraph, punctuation, style, and vocabulary. 

***This workshop is particularly useful for non-native English speakers.***

This workshop takes place in two classes and will be accompanied by a moodle site. The first class will present theory. After the first class, participants will submit a writing sample via moodle for peer review. In a supportive environment, the instructor and students will provide feedback on the writing samples. In the second class we will discuss the learning of the peer review exercise. Participation in both days and the peer review activity is mandatory, and if unmet will result in the non-attendance penalty being applied.

47975,GPLD,143,Negotiating with Confidence,2,"Great leaders negotiate based on principles. Rather than understanding negotiations as an opportunity to defeat an adversary, they work as a team together with their counterparts, to increase the value of the outcome for every stakeholder. They persuade, but within a framework of truthfulness, respect, and social responsibility, because their goal is not a short-term personal victory, but a long-term fruitful relationship that benefits everyone.
In this workshop, we will emphasize the importance of continuously improving our negotiation skills, regardless of our area of expertise. Also, we will introduce the principled negotiations model, increase our ability to identify opportunities for negotiation, and become more persuasive negotiators. Finally, the workshop will offer an opportunity to apply these concepts in practical simulations.

***If you have already taken or are planning to take GPLD147 - Embracing Your Potential: Graduate Leadership Development Program, do not register for this workshop as the same content is covered in GPLD147. ***

At the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1) Describe the interest-based negotiation process
2) Practice negotiating simulations
3) Discuss other uses for negotiation

48890,GPTK,800,Re-Envisioning your Assessments: Go Active,1.5,"Active learning allows students to take on additional responsibilities, build on existing knowledge and share in the construction of new knowledge. It stimulates questioning techniques, dialogue, choices and involves a variety of strategies designed to promote greater overall student engagement. But what happens to student engagement when it comes to assessment? A central component and a real challenge faculty face when implementing active learning is how to make learner assessments equally active so that students experience continuity. In this workshop we will look at practical strategies that can help faculty develop assessments that promote deeper learning with a particular emphasis on collaborative exams (two-stage exams). A portion of the workshop will be spent working collaboratively on the planning and design of assessments for active learning. Participants are encouraged to bring along an existing assessment to work on as part of the re-envisioning process.

Participants need a working knowledge of R (see Requirements). The purpose of the workshop is to teach the basic skills needed for importing, preparing data for analysis and visualizing scientific data in R in a reproducible manner. A key focus of the workshop is to generate different visualizations, such as violin plots, bar and line plots.
In this workshop, the following topics will be covered:
- Reproducibility: Why is it important? Best practices for writing and sharing code
- Importing data from different file types using the readr package
- Manipulating data using the dplyr package
- Writing code in an Rmarkdown document
- Plotting graphs using ggplot2 and plotly packages

***Participants need to be familiar with functions in R, data types, dataframes and basic tasks using dataframes (accessing specific rows or columns, renaming columns, etc.). Participants will need to bring their own laptop, with R (one of the latest versions: 3.4.3 or above) and RStudio installed*** If you have attended GPDI515 (Beginners Guide to R) or GPDI544 (R Bootcamp), you have all necessary requirements, however many online classes will also get to you to this level (e.g., Lessons 1 and 13 here: https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/ ).

Sophie Lemieux?s workshop will explore the constraints and opportunities related to delegation.

*KEYB*
In the cyber security world, you have to know the enemy and know yourself. That means understanding the people behind the threats: the attackers!  You have to get inside their heads and learn what motivates them, how they think and operate. At the same time, you must know your internal capabilities. That is exactly what you will do in this course. You will also learn how to extract vital strategic information from successful and failed cyber-attacks. You will develop the necessary skills to respond strategically to future attacks. Additionally, you will learn to prepare threat-intelligence reports that will be of strategic importance to your company and beneficial to your future. Ready to start?
 *** Note that you will be required to do 5-10 hours of work per week outside of class time. Those with little to no prior knowledge will require more time to gain familiarity with the concepts. ***
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
?	Extract Intelligence from incidents to gain an edge over the attacker;
?	Respond strategically to a cyber-attack by focusing on disrupting the attacker, not the symptoms of the attack; 
?	Think like an attacker and become familiar with their tools to be prepared to respond to future incidents;  
?	Prepare threat-intel reports that are actionable at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.
[LINK:https://www.concordia.ca/cce/programs/cyber-resilience/threat-intel-and-offensive-security.html|Read more about this course here]
*APP*
In this course, we take a hands-on approach to learning that's focused on the acquisition of practical, real-world skills and competencies. In short, you?ll benefit from problem-based, project-based and experiential learning led by industry experts. This course will be taught fully online in synchronous sessions. 
*WHO*
?	Professionals who want to gain expertise in threat detection, analysis and incident response.
?	Professionals who want to mitigate threats using a know-your-enemy approach. 
?	Managers and cyber security professionals who want to ensure organizational resilience and business continuity.",,,

In order to meet these challenges, innovative approaches like Universal Design for Learning (UDL) are being implemented. Designing our courses using these strategies and techniques makes them more accessible to everyone, thus reducing the need for individual accommodations.
